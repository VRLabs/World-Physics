Easy fix for Physics components behaving weirdly in world space

## How it works

This package fixes two problems that break avatar physics in VRChat:
* It fixes a collision bug by keeping mirror-copies of collider components disabled. 
* It uses an animated world fixed joint to prevent incorrect remote movement with rigidbodies under world constraints.

Unity physics is complex and making things work as you intend beyond these fixes is your responsibility.

## Install guide

* Merge the Animator Controller ``World Physics FX`` to your own FX Controller, using the [Avatars 3.0 Manager](https://github.com/VRLabs/Avatars-3.0-Manager) tool.
* Drag & drop the ``World Physics`` prefab into the base of your Hierarchy.
* Right click and unpack the prefab, then drag & drop it onto your avatar.
* Remove "World Physics Target" outside of "World Physics" and place it anywhere in your avatar's hierarchy.
  * For the demo, lift the "World Physics Target" position on the Y axis, so there is room for the cube to fall.

## How to use

* This package is intended for leaning how these fixes work so you can apply them to your own systems. It is set up for a physics demo where cube falls and collides with the world.

## Performance stats

```c++
Colliders:          1
Constraints:        2

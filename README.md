## How it works

* By turning off colliders on the mirror clone we can prevent them from colliding with the player.
* By using an animated fixed joint we can prevent incorrect movement of rigidbodies under world constraints for remote players.

## Install guide

https://github.com/VRLabs/World-Physics/assets/76777936/670ed186-a9b0-45af-8f54-a1adb4ec8541

* Merge the Animator Controller ``World Physics FX`` to your own FX Controller, using the [Avatars 3.0 Manager](https://github.com/VRLabs/Avatars-3.0-Manager) tool.
* Drag & drop the ``World Physics`` prefab into the base of your Hierarchy.
* Right click and unpack the prefab, then drag & drop it onto your avatar.
* Expand the prefab hierarchy and find ``World Physics Target``
* Move ``World Physics Target`` outside of ``World Physics`` and place it anywhere in your avatars hierarchy as needed.
  * For the demo, lift the ``World Physics Target`` position on the Y axis, so there is room for the cube to fall.

## How to use

* This package is intended for leaning how these fixes work so you can apply them to your own systems. It is set up for a physics demo where cube falls and collides with the world.
* Unity physics are complex and making things work as you intend beyond these fixes is your responsibility.
